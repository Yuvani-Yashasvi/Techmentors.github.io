    While it’s true that most businesses have been in the process of going digital, the coronavirus has sped that process up tenfold — grocery stores have moved online due to high demand, fitness brands are offering virtual workout classes, and brick-and-mortar retail shops are focused on strengthening their digital presence. Small businesses are switching up their models to survive and, in the process, are displaying some ingenious displays of creativity and spirit. 

    However, there are also companies that didn’t have to pivot — the ones that are “made” for the stay-at-home economy. Entertainment companies such as Activision Blizzard and Nintendo are winners in the video game space, while Netflix and Hulu reign supreme in video streaming. Telemedicine companies are in the spotlight, and video conferencing providers are experiencing a massive surge in profits. 
    
    Online education, in particular, is making a huge splash. MarketWatch has dubbed this time as “online education’s moment,” which comes as no surprise: Schools have closed down, so students are turning to online courses and tools. People are restricted to their homes, so they’re looking to learn new skills or hobbies through virtual classes. And businesses want to boost customer engagement, so they’re incorporating online learning into their marketing strategies. 
    
    This article covers a wide range of stories and anecdotes from online education brands that are thinking outside the box. We hope that you can draw inspiration from these (and learn a thing or two!) to better shape your marketing strategies moving forward.
