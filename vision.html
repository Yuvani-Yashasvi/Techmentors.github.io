      <h1>VISSION</h1>
     
      <p class="ii"> Setting the global standard in online, blended, and digital learning And eLearning inspires community engagement and inclusive learning environments through the use of emerging technologies also our vision Tech mentors and eLearning and Emerging Technologies will be nationally recognized as a leader in the application of innovative instructional technologies that facilitate the next generation of teaching and learning.</p>
<br><br>
      <h1>MISSION</h1>
      <p class="kk">Creating community and knowledge around quality online, blended, and digital learning while driving innovation and Our dynamic team serves the college community by providing training, research, and flexible support services. Through creative problem solving, collaboration, and reflection we provide an environment for growth in teaching and learning in an effort to best support our students, faculty and staff.  

        Tech mentor’s eLearning Support Center provides support and information to distance learners as well as on-campus students in hybrid and web-enhanced classes. Academic divisions offer many credit courses and curricula through several non-traditional delivery modes, including fully online and hybrid learning. 
        
        These delivery modes bring new learning options and opportunities to students who have diverse learning styles, those who require flexibility in their schedules, and those who do not live within commuting distance. Students can earn an A.A. degree and/or receive specific certificates through fully online courses.
        
        Tech mentors proudly offers both credit and non-credit elearning courses that require few (if any) on-campus visits. Online courses use computer technologies that translate traditional classroom instruction into learning in new and innovative ways. Classes are designed to provide close interaction with instructors when and where it best serves student needs.
        
        eLearning classes utilize technology and cover the same material as on-campus classes. Most of North Seattle eLearning courses start at the beginning of the quarter and end at the same time as on-campus courses. Credits earned through online courses are transferable and appear on transcripts just like any other class.</p>
<br><br><h1>OUR VALUES</h1><p>At The Skills, our values are not static. As a platform, we will strive to meet the needs of our students, our athletes, and the world around us. Knowledge is power and we aim to connect our athletes with their audience in an authentic and intimate way. We empower our athletes to teach what they want to teach and we believe this authenticity yields the best insights for the students.</p>
<P>Whilst constantly evolving, some of our core values are:<br><br>Education - Knowledge is power. As an online learning platform, our primary goal is to help transfer knowledge and insights from the world’s greatest athletes (our teachers) to our students.<br><br>Democratization - Very few people have the opportunity to get up close and personal with our athletes. Yet, they have so much great knowledge to offer. Our goal is to bridge that divide. Anyone, anywhere in the world with access to the internet or a phone can now sit down and learn from the best. We know democratization strives to give access to everybody and we are working on partnerships to help provide access to underserved and underprivileged communities.
    <br><br>Inspiration - Every dream starts somewhere. To become your best self requires hard work and dedication, but the journey and motivation can be found anywhere. Our hope is that our students will be inspired and educated by our world-class coaches. And with that seed of inspiration, can grow greatness.
<BR><br>Diversity - As an educational platform, diversity is critical. Diversity in our teachers. Diversity in our students. Diverse in the sports and life lessons being taught. Unlike other platforms where you might get only one sport or one athlete represented, we strive to provide multiple points of view. Whether you are learning about volleyball or mindset or teamwork, having multiple teachers and points of view is key. As far as our teachers, sports is blessed with diversity of great talent and we aim to cultivate that diversity on our platform.
    <BR><br>Authenticity - People often ask how we come up with the course outlines and how we decide what each athlete teaches. The answer is simple - we ask our athletes to be authentic to themselves. Our athletes define their own lessons and we encourage them to speak on topics that matter to them.</P>
